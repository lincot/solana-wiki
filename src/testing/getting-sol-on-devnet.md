# Getting SOL on devnet

You can request a devnet airdrop on [Sol Faucet](https://solfaucet.com/).
After testing, you can close program accounts to reclaim SOL:

```
solana program close -ud [ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]
```

To get the list of your programs to be closed:

```
solana program show -ud --programs
```
